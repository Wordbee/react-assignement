# Todo App

## Goal

Build your own version of TodoMVC with React and Redux.

## Guidelines

Take your time to grasp the mental models of React and Redux.

Take your time to read and know about idiomatic React and Redux code.

We recommand using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to bootstrap the project.

Don't be shy to show off your skills :)

## Requirements

- Use Typescript.
- Use React (of course).
- Use Redux to hold your application state.
- Use functional components and hooks
- Use either redux-thunks or redux-sags for side-effects.

Feel free to use any other redux helper libraries if you'd like to.

## CSS
