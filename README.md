# Todo App

## Goal

Build your own version of TodoMVC with React and Redux.

Take a breath! There is no right or wrong implementation. Do your best to complete the project, the interesting and important part is going through the code when you submit your solution and discussing it as peers.

## Guidelines

Take your time to grasp the mental models of React and Redux.

Take your time to read and know about idiomatic React and Redux code.

We recommand using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to bootstrap the project.

Don't be shy to show off your skills :)

## Requirements

- Use Typescript.
- Use React (of course).
- Use Redux to hold your application state.
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Persist your todos to a fake API using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- Use either redux-thunks or redux-sags for side-effects.

Feel free to use any other redux helper libraries if you'd like to.

## CSS

Use the following CSS to style the app: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-css
